# SGES_AI
Hello Wolfgang & Jose

 

Based on our discussion with Peter Streifler, we are looking for Python consultant to help us continue with solution designs and development for SGES (employees survey) comments analysis.

 

Attached, you’ll find the notebooks that was done previously by CT RDA, please have a look and see if it is something you’re familiar with.

Later this week, we hope to provide you with our dream outcome that we would like to achieve finally.

The next SGES will happen in Dec 20 / Jan 21 and we want to be ready by then – which is quite a tight timeline.

 

In this meeting, let’s conclude:

If we have the right experts for this topic
Estimated effort for this activity
Estimated cost
Way forward
 

Thank you!
